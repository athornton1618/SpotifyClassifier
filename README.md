## Abstract
Music genre classification is a complex task, which can even be difficult for humans. Using a Spotify Developer account to interface with their API, we have created our own dataset and a music genre classifier capable of identifying song genres across a much larger range of genres and subgenres than previously achieved in academic research. Additionally, we leverage Spotify's pre-processed track metadata, allowing for genre classification with only a song name as an input, rather than an audio mp3 file.

## Use Case

* Users are curious about 'Spotify Wrapped' genre listening patterns
* Spotify API only provides genre labels for artists, not tracks
* Some artists have many genres

## Dataset
* Queried Spotify for recommendations across 73 subgenres
* ~500 tracks labelled for each subgenre
* Collected Spotify metadata for individual tracks, added subgenre labels
* Grouped 73 subgenres ->11 'super-genres' for simpler classification

### Tested models
* Random Forest Classifier. Accuracy: 0.4765
* Decision Tree Classifier. Accuracy: 0.4156
* Logistic Regression. Accuracy: 0.5518
* LinearSVC. Accuracy: 0.4796
* GBT Classifier Accuracy: 0.6223
### GBT results
* Test set F1-Score: 0.6217
* Test set Precision: 0.6238
* Test set Recall:  0.6223
* Test set Accuracy: 0.6223
### Comparison to Human Performance
As a benchmark, human accuracy averages around 70% for this kind of genre classification work [1].


## Analysis
* Maybe 'super-genre' hierarchy model was an oversimplification

* Perhaps some subgenres belong to more than one cluster

* Ex: "alt-rock" = "rock"&"alternative"

* We set out to find more representative super-genres

* Also want to identify problematic (highly interconnected) subgenres

* Ranked based on subgenre overlap 

* 'chill', 'study', and 'sleep', rounded out the top 3

* Interestingly, these were all part of our 'easy-listening' super-genre 

* 'guitar', 'party, and 'acoustic' are unsurprising offenders, as they are vague
